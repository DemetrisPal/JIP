The repository contains the model developed during the project by team 2.1.1 ASML - Hydrogen. The model is in the form of an MS Excel file. The purpose of this model is to optimize for the KPI which is the price per kh of hydrogen.

In the MS Excel file, the model is using formulas. Thus it is important to make changes only by varying the values on the table on the left side of the main sheet.
